## 1. Understand the problem 

1. Can I restate the problem in my own words? (implement addition)
2. What are the inputs that go into the problem? (eg large numbers)
3. Waht are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem? (ints, floats, etc)
4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. How should I label the important pices of data that are a part of the problem?

## 2. Explore concrete examples

1. Start with simple examples
2. Progress to more complex examples
3. Explore examples with empty inputs
4. Explore examples with invalid inputs
